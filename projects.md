# [CrossTalk](https://github.com/mdtusz/crosstalk)

I made this while experimenting with Webpack, Javascript's `Object.observe` and the `BroadcastChannel` api. While working on it, I found that using `Object.observe` wasn't actually as useful as I initially thought it would be, so plain old javascript objects are used instead. Perhaps not immediately exciting, but the "library" can be used to create interfaces that work well across multiple displays without the need to use websockets or LocalStorage, for example a tools and color pallette in one window and a canvas in the other.

A node command line tool for finding out about upcoming rocket launches. Surprisingly, it's been downloaded via NPM over 400 times! To test it out, it's a simple `npm install -g blastoff` away.
