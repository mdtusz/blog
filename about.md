# Who am I?

### ***Technically***, I'm an economist. 

---

I graduated with a degree in economics from Concordia University, but in my last
year, I decided that I *much* prefered programming and software development, so 
I added in a minor in computer science. Since graduating, I've decided that 
sofware is much more in line with my interests and have dedicated myself to the 
career, working at various companies as a web developer. Most recently, I have 
been working in Montreal for AON3D, creating a host that communicates with the 
firmware controlling the machine at a low level.

When I'm not at work, I like to tinker and take things apart to see how they
work, and occasionally will play around with musical coding using tools like
[lissajous js](http://lissajousjs.com/) and occasionally start from scratch
using the web audio api. I also like to climb, but unfortunately, it's winter
right now and I don't get the opportunity to go very often.
