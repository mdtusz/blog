# Who am I?

### ***Technically***, I'm an economist.

I graduated with a degree in economics from Concordia University, but in my last year, I decided that I *much* prefered programming and development, so I added in a minor in computer science. Since graduating, I've decided that sofware is much more in line with my interests and have spent all my time furthering my learning, while developing the back end for a Montreal company called Kreate Solutions.

Recently, I've become wildly interested in highly modular software arhitecture, the increasing availability of useful open data, and "the internet of things". With the increasing availability of low cost microcontrollers and improvements to internet infrastructure all over the world, I am extremely excited to see and be a part of the future that is developing around us.
