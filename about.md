# Who am I?

### ***Technically***, I'm an economist.

---

I graduated with a degree in economics from Concordia University, but in my last
year, I decided that I *much* prefered programming and software development, so 
I added in a minor in computer science. Since graduating, I've decided that 
sofware is much more in line with my interests and have dedicated myself to the 
career, working at various companies as a software developer. Most recently, I 
have been working in Montreal for AON3D (
[we're hiring!](mailto:miklos@aon3d.com)), working on code related to 3D 
printing and begrudgingly, business related codebases as well.

When I'm not at work, I like to tinker and take things apart to see how they
work, and occasionally will play around with code based tools for things I wish
I was better at - notably, graphics (using [regl](http://regl.party) and WebGL),
CAD (using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)), and audio (using 
[lissajous js](http://lissajousjs.com/) and occasionally starting from scratch 
using the web audio api). I also like to climb, but unfortunately, it's winter 
right now and I don't get the opportunity to go very often.
