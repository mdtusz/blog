# Who am I?

### ***Technically***, I'm an economist.

---

I graduated with a degree in economics from Concordia University, but in my last year, I decided that I *much* prefered programming and software development, so I added in a minor in computer science. 
Since graduating, I've worked as a software developer and continued to dive deeper into programming languages, paradigms, theory, and software as a whole. 
Most recently, I have been working in Montreal as the lead software developer at AON3D ([we're hiring!](mailto:miklos@aon3d.com)).

When I'm not at work, I like to tinker and take things apart[^1] to see how they work, and occasionally will play around with code based tools for things I wish I was better at - notably, computer graphics, CAD modelling, and DSP.

I also like to climb and backcountry ski, but unfortunately, the global pandemic means I don't get the opportunity to go very often.
