Creating a first post for a personal website is tricky. It sets the mood for everything else that gets posted, so it's important to write in the way you want to be perceived. Should I be more laid back and casual, or technical and formal? I've already been sitting at my keyboard for too long on a hot Montreal evening, so I'm deciding to just *not* think about it and write, and try to write frequent, small snippets of posts instead of the often seen monolithic posts that some blogs have. This is partially because it takes a while for me to write, but moreso because I don't think I'm quite at a level where I can confidently write about a subject for more than a few paragraphs at a time. Until that day comes, I'll keep it short and sweet and just share my personal discoveries.
